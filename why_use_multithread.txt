在本程式中，分析的核心部分使用多線呈來處理，原因是因為，因不明原因導致，分析完成後，程式會直接離開迴圈，而不會回主選單，
然而，其實分析是有完成的，只是不知為何分析完後會有此情況，不確定這是否是預期行為，可能與CTranslate2有關，請注意，僅為可能，原因未知

使用多線呈可以解決此狀況，因為就算該分析程式因任何狀況退出，僅會退出它所在的那個線呈，而不會影響到主選單所在的主線呈


In this program, the core part of the analysis is handled using multithreading. 
This is because, for unknown reasons, after the analysis is completed, 
the program exits the loop directly instead of returning to the main menu.

However, the analysis is indeed completed successfully, 
but it is unclear why this behavior occurs afterward. 
It is not certain if this is the intended behavior and it might be related to CTranslate2. 
Please note that this is only a possibility, and the exact cause is unknown.

For reference, please see:

Using multithreading can resolve this issue because, 
even if the analysis program exits unexpectedly due to any reason, 
it will only exit the thread it is running on and will not affect the main thread where the main menu resides.
